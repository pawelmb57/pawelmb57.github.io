The schedule for **Wednesday (T-2)** is the most demanding, as it involves the breakdown of two turkeys, simultaneous sous vide cooking, and the full completion of four major side dishes.

This optimized plan prioritizes setting up all cooking environments first, then tackling the high-heat oven task (mushroom roasting), followed by the complex turkey logistics, and finally the stovetop assembly of the sides.
